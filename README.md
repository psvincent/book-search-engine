# book-search-engine

## Description 
This app was switched from a REST API to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. It uses the MERN stack with React for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, and Node/Express for the backend. This Application allows the user to sign-up, login, or logout. It also allows the user to save their favorite books into a Mongo Database.
